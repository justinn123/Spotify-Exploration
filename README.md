# Spotify-Exploration
This is a Flask web-app that gets my real-time Spotify activity using Spotipy and displays it. It gets the song I am currently listening and automatically updates the webpage so it stays accurate. It also has other pages that track the songs I listen to the most and my playlists.

## Technology
This is a Flask App and utilizes the Spotipy, a lightweight Python library for the Spotify Web API.
This library supports the usage of all the features of the Spotify Web API as well as support for user
authorization.
